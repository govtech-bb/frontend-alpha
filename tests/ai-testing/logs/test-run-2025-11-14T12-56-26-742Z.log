[2025-11-14T12:56:42.845Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): The radio button selection did not register visually. The last action was clicking 'No', but neither 'Yes' nor 'No' appears selected (checked) in the UI.

[2025-11-14T12:57:10.050Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): The validation error message is overly prescriptive, instructing the user to 'Select yes' specifically, rather than informing them that a selection is required (Yes or No). This suggests a potential bug in the validation logic or error message handling, where the error text is hardcoded to demand a specific answer despite 'No' being an available radio option.

The user selected 'No' for the marital status question, but the system displays an error message demanding that the user 'Select yes', effectively blocking the 'No' path and preventing registration of an unmarried birth.

[2025-11-14T13:04:14.130Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (medium): The 'Sex at birth' radio button field is visually selected ('Female' is checked in the UI), but the corresponding key/value pair (`child-sexAtBirth`) is missing entirely from the reported Form Values object. This indicates a discrepancy between the visual state and the application state, which will likely lead to a validation error if the user attempts to continue.
