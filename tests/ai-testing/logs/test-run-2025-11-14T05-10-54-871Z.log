The radio button selection did not register visually, and a validation error appeared. Crucially, the error message text is highly prescriptive and incorrect: 'Select yes if the mother and father were married when the child was born', suggesting 'No' is an invalid choice, which contradicts the purpose of a Yes/No field.
