[2025-11-14T05:07:24.588Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): The 'Yes' radio button was clicked, but the current visual state shows that neither 'Yes' nor 'No' is selected. The click action failed to register the selection.

[2025-11-14T05:07:52.025Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): The structured page state report is inaccurate. Although the screenshot and the elements list confirm a visible validation error message ('There is a problem' header and 'Select yes...' link), the reported state indicates "Has Errors: false" and an empty "Error Messages" list.

[2025-11-14T05:08:27.101Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): The page displays a validation error requiring the user to make a selection, even though the last action was clicking the 'Yes' radio button. This indicates that the selection was not registered correctly by the form validation logic, or the UI failed to update, leaving the form in a stuck error state.

[2025-11-14T05:09:17.024Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): A validation error is displayed and persists even though the user successfully selected the 'Yes' radio button. The error message suggests the field is incomplete or requires selection, which contradicts the current state.

[2025-11-14T05:09:45.469Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): Critical discrepancy: The page visually displays a validation error banner ('There is a problem' and an associated error link) indicating that a selection must be made, but the provided Current Page State metadata reports 'Has Errors: false' and an empty 'Error Messages' list. The 'Continue' action failed validation and did not navigate.
[2025-11-14T05:10:03.101Z] [WARN] Bug confirmed (1.00 confidence): Validation error state is not reflected in page metadata

[2025-11-14T05:10:20.522Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): The last action (clicking the 'Yes' radio button) failed to register. The radio button is not selected in the UI (it remains unchecked), and the page displays a validation error requiring a selection, preventing the user from proceeding.

[2025-11-14T05:10:45.738Z] [WARN] Anomaly detected (high): The page is clearly displaying a validation error (error summary box and error message text), indicating that a required field was missed, yet the reported system state flags `Has Errors: false` and lists no `Error Messages`. This is a critical mismatch between the visual UI state and the structured state reporting.
