## About This Directory

This directory is part of the new alpha.gov.bb platform. We're working to bring all government services and information together in one easy-to-navigate location. Content is being gradually migrated from the existing gov.bb website.

### Content Migration

Many pages are currently "stubs" that link back to the existing gov.bb website. We're working to migrate full content to this new platform while ensuring no information is lost during the transition.
