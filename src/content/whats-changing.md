How you find and use public services is changing

GovTech is leveraging technology to make it clearer, simpler and faster for people to find and use public services, and get things done.

We want everyone to:
- know where to find information about public services, and feel confident that it is accurate, so we’re creating a single source of truth, alpha.gov.bb – testing a replacement of gov.bb
- know what to expect before they start using a service, so we’re telling them the steps involved and the time it might take 
- be able to access and use public services, so we're designing inclusively and prioritising accessibility
- be able to get things done faster and feel more in control, so we're streamlining processes to be less reliant on external factors
feel confident that their data and personal information is secure and only being used when strictly necessary and with their permission
