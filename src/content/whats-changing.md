How you find and use public services is changing.

GovTech is applying user-centred service design to make it clearer, simpler and faster for people to find and use public services, and get things done.

We want everyone to:
- know where to find information about public services and feel confident that it is accurate, so we’re bringing it together onto alpha.gov.bb and testing it as a replacement for gov.bb
- know what to expect before they start using a service, so we’re telling them the steps involved and how long it might take to do something
- be able to access and use public services, so we're designing inclusively and prioritising accessibility
- be able to get things done faster and have more control, so we're streamlining processes to be less reliant on external factors
- feel confident that their data and personal information is secure and only being used when strictly necessary and with their permission
