Financial Services

**The Financial Services Commission (FSC)** is an integrated regulatory body, established on April 1st, 2011 by virtue of the Financial Services Commission Act (2010). We are responsible for supervising and regulating non-bank financial institutions in Barbados, particularly those entities licensed or registered under the following Acts of Parliament:

- Exempt Insurance Act, Cap. 308A
- Insurance Act, Cap. 310
- Occupational Pension Benefits Act, Cap. 350B
- Securities Act, Cap. 318A
- Mutual Funds Act, Cap. 320B
- Co-operatives Societies Act, Cap. 378A (as it relates to the services provided by a credit union)

FSC's main functions include those previously discharged by the former Securities Commission, Supervisor of Insurance and Pensions, and the Co-operatives Department, in so far as it relates to credit unions.

The organisation is therefore responsible for:

- Administering specified enactments, including the licensing or registering of financial institutions.
- Supervising and regulating the operation of financial institutions.

- Establishing standards for institutional strengthening, for the control and management of risk in the         financial services sector and for the protection of consumers and creditors of financial institutions.

- Promoting stability, public awareness and public confidence in the operations of financial                         institutions.
