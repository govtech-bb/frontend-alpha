Barbados Gospelfest

Barbados Gospelfest is the annual festival produced by Gospelfest (Barbados) Inc. and envisaged to be the premier international Christian music and arts festival in the Caribbean.

Barbados
Gospelfest was established in 1993 by what was then known as the Barbados
Tourist Board. The festival was the brainchild of the then Minister of Tourism
Wes Hall, now Rev. Sir Wes Hall, and the first event was a joint production
between the Barbados Tourist Board and Mr. Alvin Jones of the USA. The parties
brought Dr. Bobby Jones of Bobby Jones Gospel on board and this arrangement
gave the festival and Barbados exposure to the international Gospel community
through its airing on Dr. Jonesâ€™ television programme on Black Entertainment
Television (BET).
