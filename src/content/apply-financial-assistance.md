## Apply for financial assistance

If you live in Barbados and need welfare assistance, you can apply for financial help or in-kind assistance such as food or clothing.

A welfare officer will assess your needs under the National Assistance framework and decide if you are eligible.


### Who can use this service  

You can apply for assistance if you:

- are unemployed

- are elderly

- have a disability but are not receiving NIS benefits

- have children or dependents who you are struggling to support

Support is available for one-off events (for example, paying for a funeral), and on a short-term basis such as help to pay utility bills.

*What about disaster/accident relief? What about homelessness? Low income but not unemployed?* 



### How to apply 

You can apply for financial assistance either by:

1. Going to the welfare office in the parish where you live, completing a paper form and giving it to a welfare officer.

2. Visiting the Barbados Welfare Department’s Facebook page and completing the online form which will be automatically submitted to the department.\
   At the moment, the form does not ask for your contact number but you must include one so an officer can reach you and arrange an interview.

### Documents and information needed

You will need to show your national identification card and birth certificate. If you are applying for financial assistance on behalf of a child, you must also show their national identification card and birth certificate.

- Completed application form for national assistance in the form prescribed by regulations. 

- Proof of identity and address, contact number, and any certificates or documents the Welfare Officer requires to assess need. Examples include proof of income or unemployment, medical information if relevant, and details of dependants. 

- Bank or credit union details if opting for direct deposit of grants. 


### Get help with your application

If you want to apply but you cannot visit your local welfare office, and you cannot complete the form online either, contact the Welfare Department 



### Application process

1. Complete and submit your application in person or online. It will be assessed by a welfare officer at the welfare office in the parish where you live.  

2. Within approximately \[time period], a welfare officer will assess your application, and will ask you to provide relevant documents so they can verify your circumstances. For example, if you are applying for xx, they will ask to see your yy. If you are applying for xx, the officer will ask to see yy. Welfare officers aim to investigate your circumstances and verify your information within \[time period]. 

3. In some circumstances, you may be asked to take part in a phone interview with the officer or arrange a time for them to visit you at your home.

4. If the officer approves your application, they will arrange your in-kind support and/or they will take your bank or credit union details before arranging payments through the district paying office. 

### No address and/or no bank account

If you do not live at a fixed address, you apply for financial assistance with support from an office at a welfare office. If your application is approved, you can pick up your cheque from a pre-agreed Post Office.


### Reassessment and evaluation

*What are the rules around how long folk can claim for?*

*Do they need to do anything to continue receiving payments? For example, show they are looking for employment if their claim is based on being unemployed? Arrange regular medical assessments if their claim is based on injury?*
