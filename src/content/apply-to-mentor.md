##  Anyone aged 18 and over is eligible to apply to mentor a young person in a national youth programme. Mentors are volunteers who are able to commit regular time to support and inspire their mentee.  

# How to apply 

The Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment encourages applications \[when? Each year? Regularly?] 

\[How will people find out that applications are open?] You can follow xx to find out when you can apply. 

**How to get an application form**

Available information is vague but I think online and offline applications are accepted? Where can people get application forms?

**What you will be asked about**

As well as your contact details, the application form asks about your:

- qualifications, skills and interests

- previous experience of mentoring and being a mentee

- current and past employment

**Information you need to share**

The application form also asks you to:  

1. Share a photocopy of your National Registration card.

2. Give the names and contact details of 3 references.

**Information you might need to share** 

If your application is successful, further background checks will be carried out as part of the safeguarding process for children and young people. At a later date, you may also be asked to:

1. Share a Police Certificate of Character – you can [apply for one here](https://forms.gov.bb/CertificateOfCharacter).  

2. Attend an interview.

**Submit your application**

When you have completed the form and gathered your documents you should:

- send them to \[xx]

- take them to \[xx this might be a different place to above?]

You can expect to hear if you were successful \[approximate timeline guide]


# If your application is successful 

If you are offered a place as a mentor, you will need to complete a training course. Is this free? What’s it about? How long does it take and over what period of time?

Your skills and interests will be taken into account and you will be matched with a young person. 

What is the expected time commitment from a mentor?
