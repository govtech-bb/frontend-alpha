title: "Register a birth"
---

It is a legal requirement that all births in Barbados (including stillbirths) are registered within 28 days. 

When a child’s birth has been registered, a birth certificate can be issued. The certificate is essential for access to citizenship rights including legal identity documents, certain health services and school enrollment.

## Who should attend the registration of a birth?

You cannot register a birth online yet, so you need to do it in person in the district where the child was born. If the parents are:

* not married to each other, only the mother can go to register the birth  
* married to each other, the father can go too  
* not married to each other but the father wants his name on the birth record, both parents must attend together

The newborn does not need to be there.

#### If you cannot attend in person

If you are unable to register a birth in person, contact the Registration Department in Bridgetown as soon as possible after the child is born. 

Registration Department, Supreme Court Complex, Whitepark Road, St. Michael
(246) 434-9970

#### Late registrations 

Births must be registered within 28 days of the child being born. The process to register a birth after this time is the same but you will be charged BDS $20.00.

## What to bring

You need to show:

1. Your child’s Personal Child Health Record from the hospital (sometimes called the immunisation book or birth notification).
2. A valid form of photo identification for each parent who is present. For Barbadian citizens, your Barbados National ID card, passport or other government-issued ID is acceptable. Non-Barbadian nationals must show their passport.
3. Your marriage certificate if you are married to the child’s other parent.

#### Parents who are minors

If you are a mother or a father and you are 18 years old or younger, you must bring:
1. Your own birth certificate or passport.  
2. Your National ID card.  
3. A passport-sized photograph of yourself that has been certified by a Justice of the Peace.

## How to register a birth

1. Take your documents to the registry office in the appropriate location. You cannot book an appointment but you can find out about typically busy times by calling the office.   
2. A District Registrar or an officer will use your documents to verify your identity.  
3. You will complete a form to record the baby’s full name, date and place of birth, parents’ details (names, occupations, address)  
4. When you have reviewed and confirmed the details, the registrar or officer will enter them into the official register and can begin the process of issuing a birth certificate. A certificate can sometimes be issued on the same day but this depends on the registry office. The original costs BDS $5.00 and each additional copy is also BDS $5.00. People aged 60 and over pay a discounted fee of BDS $1.00 per certificate.
