It is a legal requirement that all births in Barbados (including stillbirths) are registered within 28 days.

Before a birth certificate can be issued, the birth must be registered. The certificate is essential for access to public services including school enrollment and certain health services.

## How to register a birth

1. Take your documents (listed below) to the registry office in the district where the child was born. You cannot book an appointment but lunchtime is typically busy.

2. A registration clerk will use your documents to verify your identity. They will then record the baby’s full name, date and place of birth, parents’ details, for example, their name, occupations and address.

3. When you have reviewed and confirmed the details, the registration clerk will ask you to sign the official register.

4. The clerk will begin the process of issuing a birth certificate. A certificate can sometimes be issued on the same day but this depends on the registry office. The original certificate costs BDS $5.00. Additional copies are available for BDS $5.00 each. People aged 60 and over pay a discounted fee of BDS $1.00 per certificate.

## Who should register a birth?

You cannot register a birth online yet, so you need to do it in person in the district where the child was born.

If the parents are:

- married to each other, the father must register and the mother can attend

- not married to each other, the mother must register the birth but it is not necessary for the father to attend

- not married to each other but the father wants to be named on the birth record, both parents must register the birth together 

You do not need to take the baby.

2. A valid form of photo identification for each parent who will be named on the birth record.For Barbadian citizens, your Barbados National ID card, passport or other government-issued ID is acceptable. Non-Barbadian nationals must show their passport.

3. Your marriage certificate if you are married to the child’s other parent.

#### Parents who are minors

If you are a mother or a father and you are 18 years old or younger, you must bring:
