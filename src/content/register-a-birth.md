It is a legal requirement that all births in Barbados (including stillbirths) are registered within 28 days. However, there is a grace period of 1 year. After this point, you will pay a late registration fee.

Before a birth certificate can be issued, the birth must be registered. The certificate is essential for access to public services including school enrollment and certain health services.

## How to register a birth

1. Take your documents (listed below) to the registry office in the district where the child was born. You cannot book an appointment but lunchtime is typically busy.

2. A registration clerk will use your documents to verify your identity. They will then record the baby’s full name, date and place of birth, parents’ details, for example, their name, occupations and address.

3. When you have reviewed and confirmed the details, the registration clerk will ask you to sign the official register.

4. The clerk will begin the process of issuing a birth certificate which will be ready to collect in 2 to 3 days. Each certified copy costs BDS $5.00.

## Who should register a birth?

You cannot register a birth online yet, so you need to do it in person in the district where the child was born. 

If the parents are:

- married to each other, the father must register and the mother can attend

- not married to each other, the mother must register the birth but it is not necessary for the father to attend

- not married to each other but the father wants to be named on the birth record, both parents must register the birth together

You do not need to take the baby.

## What to bring

You need to show:

1. Your child’s Personal Child Health Record from the hospital or birthing centre (sometimes called the immunisation book or birth notification).

2. A valid form of photo identification for each parent who will be named on the birth record.  
For Barbadian citizens, your Barbados National ID card, valid passport or other government-issued ID is acceptable. Non-Barbadian nationals must show their valid passport.

3. Your original marriage certificate if you are married to the child’s other parent.

#### Parents who are minors

If you are a mother or a father and you are under 16 years old, you are considered a minor.

If you have a valid passport, you must bring:

- your valid passport

- your original birth certificate

- the child’s medical book (green book)

You must be accompanied by your parent(s) or guardian(s).


If you do not have a valid passport, you must bring:

- your minor’s identification card

- your original birth certificate

- the child’s medical book (green book)

- an identification letter signed by a Justice of the Peace

You must be accompanied by your parent(s) or guardian(s). 

If you don’t meet these criteria, contact the Registrations Department.
