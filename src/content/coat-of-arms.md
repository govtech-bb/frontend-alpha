## Coat of Arms

![Coat of Arms of Barbados](https://www.gov.bb/media_files/barbados-1386184_640.png)

The grant of arms conveyed by royal warrant was presented by Her Majesty the Queen to the President of the Senate of the island on February 14, 1966, on the occasion of the Royal Visit to Barbados.

Prior to this grant of Arms, the only other heraldic device was the seal of the colony. It represented the British Sovereign in a shell chariot being drawn by two sea horses through foaming waves. The seal was changed when there was a new monarch. King sits in the chariot while the Queens stand.

The Golden Shield of the Arms carries two Pride of Barbados flowers (the National Flower) and the Bearded Fig Tree (ficus Citrifolia) which was common on the island at the time of its settlement. On either side of the shield are the supporters. On the right (Dexter) is a dolphin symbolic of the fishing industry and on the left (sinister) is a Pelican. The association is made with a small island named Pelican Island which existed off Barbados and which was incorporated into the Deep Water Harbour development.

Above the shield is a helmet and mantling and on a wreath is the arm and hand of a Barbadian holding two crossed pieces of sugar cane symbolic of the sugar industry. This is a saltire cross, the cross upon which Saint Andrew was crucified. Independence day in Barbados is celebrated on November 30, Saint Andrews Day.

The Coat of Arms carries the motto "Pride and Industry."

The Barbados Coat of Arms was designed by Mr. Neville C. Connell. Mr. Connell was a director of the Barbados Museum for almost 24 years. He was a prolific writer and contributed a great number of articles for the Museum Journals, local newspapers as well as publications overseas.
