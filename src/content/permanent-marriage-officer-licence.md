Application for a Permanent Marriage Officer's Licence

***Please be advised that the granting of
the Marriage Officer's licence is not automatic upon the submission of the applicant's
documents.  It is also important to note
that the ordained Minister of Religion must be resident in Barbados and be
operating as a Minister/Imam at a registered church/mosque (for muslims) in Barbados.***

***Following the submission of the
application to this office, the applicant would be advised of his/her interview
date, in due course. In certain cases, the Chairman reserves the right on
behalf of the Committee to grant approval without the applicant appearing
before the Committee.***

***The meeting of the Marriage Officers Committee is mainly contingent on the amount of applicants for Marriage
Officers Licences.  The MOC usually
interviews between ten and fifteen applicants, therefore there is no specified
date (for example, February 9 or October 5) for the convening of these
meetings.***
