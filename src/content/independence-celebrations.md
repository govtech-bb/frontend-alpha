Community Independence Celebrations Secretariat

The Community Independence Celebrations Secretariat was established in August 1995 within the office of the Prime Minister to formulate "A Community Approach to Independence".

This "New Approach" was intended to deepen and broaden people-participation in our Independence celebrations. The programme of community activities is geared towards generating and reinforcing self-help and parochial resourcefulness and stimulating greater pride in the community and nation.

In a break from tradition, the entire month of November and not just Independence Day, November 30, is now designated for celebrating the Spirit of Independence through community activities organised by community-based organisations and the Parish Independence Committees.
