If you are concerned about the welfare of an elderly person, you should use this service to report it to the authorities so they can investigate and intervene. Friends and family, members of the public, caregivers or professionals can report suspected abuse, neglect or mistreatment. The victim can also file a report themself.

## What abuse, neglect and mistreatment mean

If you are unsure whether what you suspect or have witnessed is abuse, neglect or mistreatment, here are the definitions.

**Abuse** – treating someone cruelly or violently, once or multiple times.

**Neglect** – continuously failing to meet someone’s basic needs such as food, shelter, clothing, emotional support, and medical care.

**Mistreatment** – threatening, humiliating or belittling behaviour that disrespects someone’s dignity.

## Where to report a concern 

You cannot report your concern online yet, so you need to do it in person. If you are concerned about:

- Abuse – go to your local police station to file a report

- Neglect and/or mistreatment – go to \[social care or welfare department] to file a report.

In an emergency, call the police on \[number]

## How to report a concern

At the police station or the social care or welfare department, \[you will be given a form to complete / a government official will ask you questions so they can complete a report on your behalf]

The \[form asks about/the official] will ask you for:

1. The name, age and address of the elderly person.

2. The nature of your concern.

3. Evidence if it is available. For example, medical reports and/or photographs of injury. They will also ask the name of any witnesses so they can ask them for a statement.

4. Information about the person or people who you suspect – or know to be – responsible.

5. Your contact information. You can also remain anonymous.

## After you report a concern

The relevant authority will open a case as soon as possible and begin its investigation into whether the elderly person is in danger and if intervention is needed. For example, it may put a protection order in place, or arrange for the victim to move to a safe place.

## If you cannot report a concern in person

If you have difficulty reporting a concern in person, you can contact the Ministry or Social Empowerment Agency for help.
