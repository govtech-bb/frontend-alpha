If you are concerned about the welfare of an elderly person, you should use this service to report it to the authorities so they can investigate and intervene.

Friends and family, members of the public, caregivers or professionals can report suspected abuse, neglect or mistreatment. The victim can also file a report themself.

## What abuse, neglect and mistreatment mean

If you are unsure whether what you suspect or have witnessed is abuse, neglect or mistreatment, here is The World Health Organisation’s definition:

A single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes physical, sexual, psychological and emotional abuse; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect.

## How to report a concern

### Visit, call or email

You cannot report your concern online yet, so you need to either:

1. Go to a police station, or call on 211. You will be directed to the relevant station.

2. Go to, call or email the National Assistance Board. You will be put in touch with a welfare officer.

### Speak to a welfare officer

A welfare officer will ask you:

1. The name, age and address of the elderly person.

2. The nature of your concern.

3. If there is any evidence available. For example, medical reports and/or photographs of injury.

4. The name of any witnesses so they can ask them for a statement.

5. Information about the person or people who you suspect – or know to be – responsible.

6. Your contact information. But you can choose to remain anonymous.

## After you report a concern

The police or the National Assistance Board will do an assessment as soon as possible and investigate whether an intervention is needed. If it is, the welfare officer and a police person may help arrange for the victim to move to a safe place until conflict is resolved. This might mean that the elderly person stays with family or friends.
