What is the ezpay@gov.bb Payments Platform?

The Government of Barbados has created a facility where citizens can pay for various government services online from their bank accounts via direct debit, in the first instance.

Payments can be made 24/7 at your convenience.

What are the Requirements?

- An account on the Barbados Integrated Government (BIG) Portal (www.gov.bb)
- A bank account at any of the commercial banks in Barbados.

It is recommended that you register for online banking if provided. This is to speed up the process of the Bank Account Number validation.

- A valid billing account at the particular government agency to which payment is being made e.g. the Land Tax Department.
