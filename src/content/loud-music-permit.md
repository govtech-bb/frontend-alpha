## Who needs a license to play loud music?

Businesses, organisations and individuals need a permit if they want to play loud music. 

Loud music means music you can hear outside the boundary of a property, or at a time when people would reasonably expect quiet.

These groups need a permit regardless of:

- whether they are selling tickets or their event is free

- the start and end time of the event  

- whether they are hosting a single or a series of events

- the number of attendees

- whether the event will be held in a rural or residential area

Venues can [apply for an annual permit to play loud music](https://publicentertainment.bra.gov.bb/) with the Barbados Revenue Authority.

## How to apply for a license 

The Commissioner of Police advises you should apply for a loud music license 4 weeks before your event. However, to be safe, it is a good idea to do it as soon as possible.

The application steps are largely the same regardless of whether you are applying as an individual, or on behalf of a business, organisation or venue. 

Write a letter or email to the Police Commissioner’s office at Barbados Police Service headquarters in Bridgetown. You must state:

- your full name

- your telephone number

- your email address

- your home address

- the name of the event 

- the event location 

- the event date

- the event start and finish times

- a brief explanation of the type of event you are planning

- an estimate of the number of people you expect to attend

It may help your application if you include information on how you have considered the environment close to the event location. This might include the potential impact on neighbours, businesses, wildlife and infrastructure in terms of things like noise and traffic.

## After you’ve applied

It can take up to 4 weeks for your application to be processed. 

You will receive a decision from the police department in the area that your event is planned to take place. It is unlikely your application will be refused but if it is, the police will explain why so you can make changes to your proposal.

If your application is approved, you will receive a paper and a digital certificate from the police department in the area where your event is planned to take place. Take your certificate to your event. It must be available for inspection if the police ask to see it.
