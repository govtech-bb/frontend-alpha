- (iii) The flag-mast should be painted white.
- (iv) No other flag may be flown above the Barbados flag. When several flags are flown on one halliard the Barbados flag is placed at the peak. when the Flags of two or more nations are displayed together they are to be flown from separate staffs of the same height and all flags should be, as far as possible, of the same size. The flag of one nation should not be displayed above that of another.
- (v) No other flag, colour, standard, ensign or other emblems should be displayed above or to the right of the National Flag, i.e. the observer's left facing it.
- (vi) When two flags are placed against a wall with crossed staffs, the Barbados Flag should be at the right - i.e. to the observer's left facing the flags Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag. When a number of flags are grouped and displayed from staffs the Barbados Flag should be at the Centre and at the highest point of the group.
- (vii) When the National Flag is flown with other flags it should be the first to be hoisted and the last to be lowered while the other flags are flying or being hoisted.
- (viii) The Flag may be displayed flat above and behind the speaker in a church or in an auditorium. If on a staff, it should be at the right of the speaker as he faces the congregation or audience. Other flags should be at the speaker's left. If the flag is displayed on a staff elsewhere than on a platform or chancel it should be at the right of the audience or congregation as they face the speaker. It should not cover a speaker's desk or be draped in front of a platform.
- (ix) Except on a day of special significance, the National Flag shall not be flown on a motor car without the permission of the minister.
