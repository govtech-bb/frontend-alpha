Each year, every child is entitled to a BDS $100 textbook grant while they are a student at a public or private primary school. The aim of this initiative is to financially support parents and guardians so that their children have access to school books.

Parents or guardians must only complete one application form per child.

## Who is ineligible

If the child is currently receiving support through the Primary School Textbook system, you are not eligible to claim the $100 Primary School Textbook Grant as well.

## When to apply

You can apply for the grant any time but applying in July or August means the funds are more likely to be available in time for the start of the new school year.

## How to apply

Complete the online application form: [Apply for a BDS $100 textbook grant](https://eforms.gov.bb/f/100grant2025)

The form ask for:
1. Parent or guardian contact details.
2. Bank account information so the funds can be paid.
3. The student’s name, ID number and class.


## After you’ve applied

BDS $100 will be paid into the bank account given on the form.


## If you cannot complete the form online

You can visit your child’s school between 10am and midday to receive assistance.
