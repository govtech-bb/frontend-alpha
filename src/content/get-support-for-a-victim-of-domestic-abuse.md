If you, or someone you know, is experiencing domestic violence, you can use this service to:

- get emergency assistance

- seek protection

- find support services

## What is domestic abuse?

The term domestic abuse (sometimes referred to as domestic violence) is a single incident or a recurring pattern of controlling, coercive, threatening, degrading, or violent behaviour. It can be physical, emotional, financial and/or sexual abuse.

In most cases, a partner or ex-partner is the domestic abuser. Sometimes, the perpetrator is a family member or carer.

## How and where to get the right support

The Police and the Family Conflict Unit (a specialist part of the Police) work together on issues concerning domestic abuse. But as a first step, here’s who you should contact depending on what you need.

## What support might look like

The Police and the Family Conflict Unit will use their powers and take appropriate action. Every case is different, but here are ways they are able to help.

### Open an investigation

For example, they might:

- record victim statements

- do a risk assessment focusing on the victim’s exposure to harm and the behaviour of the perpetrator

- interview those who may have witnessed the abuse or are involved in another way

### Explain possible next steps to the victim

For example, they might explain the considerations around and the process of:

- prosecuting the aggressor

- applying for a protection order

### Offer practical and emotional support

For example, the Police or Family Conflict Unit may:

- help victims apply for a protection order by completing the Protection Order Form 1 with them and taking a statement

- issue an emergency protection order (usually effective immediately and valid for 7 days). They may advise the victim to apply to the court for an extension of the protection order

- help victims relocate to a safe space

- help victims get medical attention

- help victims find trauma support such as counselling. They may also help victims apply for additional trauma-related support through the Victim Rights Form 7

- consulting with the Child Care Board (now referred to as the Social Empowerment Agency) on disputes involving children

### Aftercare

The Police or Family Conflict Unit may offer risk management and follow-up support.
