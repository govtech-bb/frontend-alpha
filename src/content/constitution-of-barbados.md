The Constitution of Barbados, originally the Schedule to the Barbados Independence order, was laid before Parliament on 22 November 1966 and entered into force on 30 November of the same year. It is the supreme law of Barbados.

Executive power is vested in the Barbadian monarch and is exercised by his or her vice-regal representative, on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who, together, form the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the Parliament. The Constitution does not contain provisions concerning the protection of intellectual property rights.

However, article 16 of the Constitution provides for protection from deprivation of property without compensation, which can be interpreted in various manners.
