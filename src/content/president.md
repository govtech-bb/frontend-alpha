She served on the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child from its inception in 1991 until 1999, serving both as Chair and Vice-Chair.</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px;">She was also one of two women who </span><span style="font-size: 18px;">were</span><span style="font-size: 18px;"> appointed to the 13-member CARICOM Commission charged with evaluating regional integration.</span>
