Learn about how the Government of Barbados is structured and operates.

## Parliament

![Parliament of Barbados](https://www.gov.bb/media_files/DSC_3533%20min2.jpg)

The Parliament of Barbados is the national legislature of Barbados. It is accorded legislative supremacy by Chapter V of the Constitution of Barbados. The Parliament is bicameral in composition and is formally made up of the President, an appointed Senate (Upper house), and an elected House of Assembly (Lower house). Both houses sit in separate chambers in the Parliament Buildings (commonly known as "The Public Buildings"), in the national capital Bridgetown in Saint Michael.

The Senate is made up of twenty-one Senators and the President, while the House consists of thirty Members of Parliament (MPs) in addition to the Honourable Speaker of the House. Members to serve in the Cabinet of Barbados may be chosen by the Prime Minister from either the House of Assembly or Senate (the Prime Minister alone must come from the House of Assembly).

In theory, supreme legislative power is vested in the President-in-Parliament; in practice during modern times, real power is vested in the House of Assembly, as the President generally acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and the powers of the Senate have been limited.

The Parliament of Barbados is originally patterned after the Parliament of England, so the structure, functions, and procedures of the parliament are based on the Westminster system of government.

Sittings of both House and Senate are usually held once per month, with other meetings called as necessary. The House sits on Tuesdays beginning at 10:30 am and are broadcast live on the local radio station, Quality 100.7 FM. Sittings of the Senate take place on Wednesdays.

## House of Assembly

The House of Assembly comprises 30 members elected by adult suffrage on the first-past-the-post system.

The Presiding Officer of the House of Assembly is the Speaker. Visitors to the public gallery are called Strangers. The House of Assembly usually meets on Tuesday, but if there is urgent business a meeting can be called on any other day. Senate usually sits on Wednesday.

### Highlights of the House of Assembly

The Speaker's chair is a gift from the Government of India to the People of Barbados on attainment of our Independence on November 30, 1966.

The stained-glass windows, which were manufactured in the 1870s by Clayton and Bell of the UK, feature the British Monarchs from 1603 to 1636 including Oliver Cromwell who was Lord Protector 1653-1958.

The life of a Parliament is for five years from its first sitting after a general election.

### The Hallway

The main entrance to the House of Assembly has a Bust of Sir William Conrad Reeves the first black person to be knighted. His many achievements included many years of outstanding service in the practice of the law, as a law officer, as a member of the House of Assembly and 16 years as Chief Justice of Barbados. His career was a long record of faithful service to all classes of this country.

At the entrance to the Chamber is a list of all Members of the House of Assembly since adult suffrage in 1951.

## The Senate

The Senate comprises 21 members. These members are appointed by the following process:

- **12** appointed by the Prime Minister
- **7** appointed by the President at their discretion to represent various interests in the community, such as religious, economic, social or other interests they think ought to be represented
- **2** appointed by the Leader of the Opposition

Senators may also be appointed as Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries. The Senate meets chiefly when there is business from the House of Assembly.

The Presiding Officer of the Senate is the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate sometimes performs the functions of the office of President when the President is away from their post.

**The Senate is referred to as the Upper House.**

### Highlights of the Senate

The Senate Chamber features a fine oval mahogany table which is part of the original furniture of the Chamber.

The stained-glass windows in the Senate feature the Coats of Arms of former Speakers of the House and Presidents of the Legislative Council which preceded the Senate.

The chandeliers are made of Waterford Crystal and were a joint presentation by Lord Wedgwood of Barlston, England, and Mr. Geoffrey Cave of Cave Shepherd to the people of Barbados for the 350th Anniversary of Parliament in 1989.
