You should complete the redirection mail in one go. At the moment, it is not possible to save your answers and come back to them later.

## How long does it take?

It shouldn’t take longer than 10 minutes.

## What you will need

You will need a debit or credit card because you must pay $4 BBD online as part of the process. You will also need to have (or create) an EZPay+ account.

You will need to share:

- The name and National Identification number of the person applying
- name(s) of every other person who also wants to redirect their mail
- the old address
- the new address
- start date of redirection
- end date if the redirection is only temporary
