You should complete the redirection mail in one go. At the moment, it is not possible to save your answers and come back to them later.

## How long does it take?

It shouldn’t take longer than 10 minutes.

## What you will need

<!-- You will need a debit or credit card because you must pay $30 BBD online as part of the process. You will also need to have (or create) an EZPay+ account. -->

You will need to share:

- the full name and National Identification number of the person applying on behalf of the business
- the Certificate of Incorporation with the official stamp
- the business registration number
- the old address
- the new address
- start date of redirection
- end date of the redirection
