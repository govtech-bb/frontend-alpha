   You must complete the paper form by hand and return it to any Post Office. You can pay the $30 BBD by credit or debit card, or in cash, at the branch.

### What you will need to share

The redirection form asks you to share:

- the full name and National Identification number of the person applying on behalf of the business
- the Certificate of Incorporation with the official stamp
- the business registration number
- the old address
- the new address
- start date of redirection
- end date of the redirection

## After you have submitted the form

The person who is applying on behalf of the business must visit any Post Office, in person, to:

1. Sign the form.
2. Verify their identity with their National ID card.
3. Show the Certificate of Incorporation.

If you complete the online redirection form, the Post Office cashier will ask for the reference number on the confirmation email.

## After the Post Office has processed your request

The Barbados Postal Service will begin to deliver your mail to your new address from the start date you gave on the form.

Your redirection notice will last for a maximum of 6 months. After the notice has expired, all mail will be delivered to the address it has on it. Therefore, you should update the relevant people and businesses on your new address.

The Post Office is responsible for this service.
