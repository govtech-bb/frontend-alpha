## Barbados National Oil Company

The Barbados National Oil Company Limited (BNOCL) was incorporated in February 1983 following the cessation of onshore exploration and production operations in Barbados by Mobil Explorations Inc.

The company’s primary objective and core business is the economic exploration and production of the country’s hydrocarbon potential onshore Barbados. Its secondary but equally important objective is to ensure that on a sustainable, efficient and reliable basis, energy products are supplied to the country at the most competitive prices.
