If you have the power of attorney for someone, you can use this service to tell the Post Office that they have died and therefore you would like to redirect their mail to a different address.

A redirection notice will last for 6 months.

There are a separate forms if you would like to:

- [redirect your personal mail](/travel-id-citizenship/post-office-redirection-individual/)
- [redirect your business mail](/travel-id-citizenship/post-office-redirection-business/)

## How to redirect someone’s mail after their death

### Complete the form

There are 2 ways to do this. You can:

1. Tell the Post Office online

   You can complete the redirection form online. You must pay online as part of the process so you will need a debit or credit card, and you will need to have (or create) an EZPay+ account.

2. Get a paper redirection form any Post Office

   You must complete it by hand and return it to any Post Office.

### What you will need to share

Along with your contact details, the redirection form asks you to share:

- proof you have lasting power of attorney
- your details including your relationship to the person who has died
- details of the person who has died including their address
- where mail should be redirected to
- start date of redirection
- end date if the redirection is only temporary

### After you tell the Post Office

The Barbados Postal Service will begin to deliver your mail to the new address from the start date you gave on the form. Your redirection notice will last for 6 months.

The Post Office is responsible for this service.
