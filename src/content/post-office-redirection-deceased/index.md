You can use this service to tell the Post Office that someone has died and therefore you would like to redirect their mail to a different address. 

A redirection notice will last for 6 months.

There are separate forms if you would like to:

- [redirect your personal mail](/travel-id-citizenship/post-office-redirection-individual/)
- [redirect your business mail](/travel-id-citizenship/post-office-redirection-business/)

## Who can use the service

Only the person who is named as executor of the will can redirect the mail. The executor must present Letters Testamentary to the Post Office before the redirection can be processed. You need to take the will to the Supreme Court to get Letters Testamentary.

If there is no will, the deceased’s next of kin (or other persons entitled by law) may apply to the High Court for a grant of Letters of Administration.

You can [read more about Letters Testamentary and Letters of Administration](https://www.barbadoslawcourts.gov.bb/court-administration/supreme-court-registry/probate-unit) on the Barbados Judicial System website.

## How to redirect someone's mail after their death

* where mail should be redirected to
* start date of redirection
* end date of the redirection (a redirection notice lasts a maximum of 6 months)

You must visit any Post Office, in person, to:

1. Sign the form.  
2. Verify your identity with your National ID card.  
3. Present proof you have authority to act on behalf of the deceased person. This could be the Letters Testamentary or the Letters of Administration.

If you complete the online redirection form, the Post Office cashier will ask for the reference number on the confirmation email.
