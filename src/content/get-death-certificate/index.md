This service can be used to get a copy of a death certificate for anyone whose death was registered in Barbados.

Most copies of death certificates are requested soon after the death takes place and is registered.

However, copiesssss for a deceased Barbadian citizen can be requested at any point. They are essential for sorting out the deceased’s estate, and for insurance purposes.

You can request a copy on someone else’s behalf but you must disclose:

- your relationship to them
- why you need the certificate

## Cost of certificates

Each certified copy costs $5 BBD.

## After your request is processed

A copy of a death certificate is usually ready to collect in 5 to 7 business days.

However, if the death registration needs a coroner’s certificate, it can take longer and is dependent on the Coroner's Office.

A certificate can sometimes be issued on the same day, in the case of a medical or travel emergency. You will need to show proof of the emergency.

If you complete the paper form, you will be given a receipt when you return it to the Applications Desk at the Registration Department. You will need to show your receipt when you collect your cop(y/ies) and you will be able to pay in cash or by card.

## If basic information is unknown

There are circumstances when you may not be able to provide all the information asked for in the form. For example, if there is estrangement in the family, or if the birth was registered in Barbados a significant time ago. Provide as much information as you can – the more details you can give, the better the chance of finding the records you are looking for.
