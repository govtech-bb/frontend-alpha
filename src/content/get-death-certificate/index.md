This service can be used to get a copy of a death certificate for anyone whose death was registered in Barbados.

Most copies of death certificates are requested soon after the death takes place and is registered.

However, copies for a deceased Barbadian citizen can be requested at any point. They are essential for sorting out the deceased’s estate, and for insurance purposes.

You can request a copy on someone else’s behalf but you must disclose:

- your relationship to them
- why you need the certificate
