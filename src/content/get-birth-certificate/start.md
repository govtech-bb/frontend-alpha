You should complete your application in one go. At the moment, it is not possible to save your answers and come back to them later.

You cannot use the online service if you would like the certificate to be sent overseas. Instead, contact the Registration Department.

## How long does it take?

It shouldn’t take longer than 20 minutes.

## What you will need

You will need a debit or credit card, and you will need to have (or create) an EZPay+ account.

Each certified copy costs $5 BBD. People aged 60 and over pay $1 BBD per certificate.

The form asks for:

- the applicant’s name, address and National ID number
- the full name, date of birth, place of birth and place of baptism of the person named on the certificate
- the full name(s) of the parent(s) of the person named on the certificate
