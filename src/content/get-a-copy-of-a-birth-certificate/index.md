This service can be used to get a copy of a birth certificate for anyone whose birth was registered in Barbados. 

Most copies of birth certificates are requested at the same time a birth is registered as part of the [Register a birth service](https://alpha.gov.bb/family-birth-relationships/register-a-birth). A copy is essential for access to certain public services and welfare support. 

However, copies for Barbadian citizens can be requested at any point. They are needed as official identification so you can apply for a passport or driving licence, and as proof of identity in financial or legal-related matters such as opening a bank account or getting married.

You can request a copy on someone else’s behalf but you must disclose:

* your relationship to them  
* why you need the certificate
