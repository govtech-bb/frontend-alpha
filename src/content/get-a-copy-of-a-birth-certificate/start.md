# Get a copy of a birth certificate

### You should complete your application in one go. At the moment, it is not possible to save your answers and come back to them later.

## How long does it take? 

It shouldn’t take longer than 20 minutes.

## What you will need

You will need a debit or credit card. Each certified copy costs $5 BBD. People aged 60 and over pay $1 BBD per certificate. 

The form asks for:

* the applicant’s name, address and National ID number  
* the full name, date of birth, place of birth and place of baptism of the person named on the certificate  
* the full name(s) of the parent(s) of the person named on the certificate

Unknown information

There are circumstances when you may not be able to provide all the information asked for in the form. For example, if there is estrangement in the family, or if the birth was registered in Barbados a significant time ago. Provide as much information as you can – the more details you can give, the better the chance of finding the records you are looking for.
