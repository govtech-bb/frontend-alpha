## Unknown information

There are circumstances when you may not be able to provide all the information asked for in the form. For example, if there is estrangement in the family, or if the birth was registered in Barbados a significant time ago. Provide as much information as you can – the more details you can give, the better the chance of finding the records you are looking for.
