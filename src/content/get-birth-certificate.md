Parents and guardians can use this service to get a birth certificate, or a copy of a birth certificate, for their child if their child’s birth was registered in Barbados. Authorised representatives are also eligible to use this service.

Most birth certificates and copies are requested at the same time a birth is registered, because a certificate is essential for access to certain public services. However, certificates and copies can be requested at any point.

## How to get a certificate

You cannot request a certificate online yet, so you need to get an Application for birth certificate form from the Registration Department in person, and complete it by hand.

### Complete the form

The form asks for the name and date of birth of the person whose birth certificate is requested, as well as the name of their parent(s).

### Gather your supporting information

You will need to share:

- a photocopy \[photo/scan?] of your ID. For example, \[xxx]

- proof you have been authorised to apply on behalf of another person. For example, \[xxx]

### Pay the fee

You can pay in cash or by card at the Registration Department. You will need to keep your receipt for collection.\
The original certificate costs BDS $5.00. Additional copies are available for BDS $5.00 each. People aged 60 and over pay a discounted fee of BDS $1.00 per certificate. 

### Submit your request

Submit your form and supporting documents to the Registration Department to the certificate clerk. 


## After your request is processed

A certificate is usually ready in 2 to 3 working days. You will need to show your receipt and collect your certification from the Registration Department.

A certificate can sometimes be issued on the same day but this depends on the registry office. 


### Get a birth certificate if you live overseas 

Contact the Registration Department and they will send you an Application for a birth certificate form.

Complete the form.

Send a money order for BDS $ \[xx] to cover the cost of the certificate and the processing fee. There will be an additional cost depending on the return postage fee. Money orders should be made out to the Registrar of the Supreme Court.
