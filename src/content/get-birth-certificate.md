Parents and guardians can use this service to get a birth certificate for their child if their child’s birth was registered in Barbados.

Most birth certificates are requested at the same time a birth is registered because a certificate is essential for access to certain public services. Certificates for Barbadian citizens can be requested at any point.

## How to get a certificate

You cannot request a certificate online yet, so you need to collect an Application for birth certificate form from the Registration Department, and complete it by hand.

Registration Department  
Supreme Court Complex  
Whitepark Road  
St. Michael  
(246) 535-9700  
Open Monday to Friday: 8:30am and 3:15pm  

### Complete the form

The form asks for:

- the child’s full name
- the child’s date of birth
- the child’s place of birth
- the parents’ full names 
- the mother’s maiden name 

### Pay the fee

Each certified copy costs BDS $5.00. People aged 60 and over pay BDS $1.00 per certificate. You can pay in cash or by card at the Registration Department. You will need to keep your receipt for collection. 

### Submit your request

Submit your form and receipt to the Applications Desk.  

## After your request is processed

A certificate is usually ready in 2 to 3 working days. You will need to show your receipt and collect your certification from the Registration Department.

A certificate can sometimes be issued on the same day but this depends on the registry office.
