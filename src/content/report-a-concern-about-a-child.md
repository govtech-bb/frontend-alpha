If you are concerned about the welfare of a child (a person under the age of 18), you should use this service to report it to the Child Care Board (CCB) and /or the police so they can investigate and intervene. Friends and family, members of the public, or professionals such as health providers or social workers can report suspected abuse, neglect or mistreatment.

The victim can also file a report themself.

You can choose to report a concern anonymously.

## What abuse, neglect and mistreatment mean

If you are unsure whether what you suspect or have witnessed is abuse, neglect or mistreatment, here is the definition:

A single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to the child. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes verbal, physical, sexual, psychological and emotional abuse; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect.

## Where to report a concern

You cannot report your concern online yet, so you need to do it in person, by email or over the phone.

The Child Care Board and the police work together in this area so if you report a concern to one of them, they may share it with the other.

## How to report a concern

Child care officer will ask you for:

1. The name, age and address of the child.

2. The name of the school the child goes to.

3. The nature of your concern so they can determine the level of risk. For example, violence, neglect, abandonment, or exploitation.

3. Evidence if it is available. For example, medical reports and/or photographs of injury. They will also ask the name of any witnesses so they can ask them for a statement.

4. Information about the person or people who you suspect – or know to be – responsible.

5. Your contact information and your relationship to the child. You can also remain anonymous.

## After you report a concern

The Child Care Board will open a case as soon as possible. If the child is:

- in serious danger, CCB officers attend immediately with the police

- under 5, CCB officers begin their investigation in less than 24 hours

Officers may visit the child’s home and/or school; interview the child, their parents and/or teachers as well as other people who are in close contact with the minor.

If the investigation shows that an intervention is needed, the Child Care Board can move the child into care, or apply for protection orders through the courts. The CCB will refer the case to police for further investigation if it suspects abuse. Police will determine if it is a criminal offence.
