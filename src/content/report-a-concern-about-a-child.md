If you are concerned about the welfare of a child (a person under the age of 18), you should use this service to report it to the authorities so they can investigate and intervene. Friends and family, members of the public, or professionals such as health providers or social workers can report suspected abuse, neglect or mistreatment. 

The victim can also file a report themself.


## What abuse, neglect and mistreatment mean
If you are unsure whether what you suspect or have witnessed is abuse, neglect or mistreatment, here are the definitions.

**Abuse** – treating someone cruelly or violently, once or multiple times.

**Neglect** – continuously failing to meet someone’s basic needs such as food, shelter, clothing, emotional support, and medical care.

**Mistreatment** – threatening, humiliating or belittling behaviour that disrespects someone’s dignity.

## Where to report a concern 

You cannot report your concern online yet, so you need to do it in person. If you are concerned about:

* Abuse – go to your local police station to file a report
* Neglect and/or mistreatment – visit the Child Care Board (Fred Edghill Building, Cheapside, Bridgetown) or Ministry of People Empowerment and Elder Affairs welfare office(MPEA) (4th Floor Warrens Office Complex, Warrens, St. Michael) 

In an emergency, call the police on \[number]


## How to report a concern 

\[At xx place / When you call xx…  
you will be given a form to complete / a government official will ask you questions so they can complete a report on your behalf]

The \[form asks about/the official] will ask you for:

1. The name, age and address of the child.

2. The nature of your concern. For example, neglect, abandonment, or exploitation.

3. Evidence if it is available. For example, medical reports and/or photographs of injury. They will also ask the name of any witnesses so they can ask them for a statement.

4. Information about the person or people who you suspect – or know to be – responsible.

5. Your contact information and your relationship to the child. You can also remain anonymous. 

## After you report a concern

The Child Care Board will open a case as soon as possible and begin its investigation. Officials may decide to visit the child’s home, interview the child, their parents and/or teachers as well as others in close contact with the minor.

If the investigation shows that an intervention is needed, the Child Care Board can move the child into care, or apply for protection orders through the courts. They will involve the police if they suspect or identify criminal offences have taken place.

## After you report a concern

The Child Care Board takes immediate action in life-threatening cases and responds urgently to cases where a child is in immediate danger. Other concerns are investigated as quickly as possible. 

An official may visit the child’s home, speak with the child and family, and involve health or school officials. If abuse is found, they can place the child into care or apply to the court for protection.

## If you cannot report a concern in person

If you have difficulty reporting a concern in person, you can contact the Ministry or Social Empowerment Agency for help.
