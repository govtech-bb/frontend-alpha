When an individual or a business wants to do something like transfer land ownership, or enter into a commercial contract, they may be asked to provide copies of official documents. These copies need to be notarised as true copies of the original by the notary (a qualified legal professional).

Often, notarisation is used for documents that need to be authenticated before for use overseas. However, it is also sometimes used in domestic circumstances.

## How to get a document notarised

### Where to go

This service is not available online yet so you will need to visit a notary public in person. You can go to any of the following places to get a document notarised:

#### Supreme Court
Whitepark Road

Saint Michael  

#### Intellectual Property Office
Baobab Tower  
Highway 2  
Saint Michael  


### What to take

You will need:

1. Your original document.

2. A photocopy of your original document.

3. Valid photo ID. 


### The process

The notary will:

1. Compare your original document and the photocopy.

2. Sign and date the copy if they are happy it is a true copy.  
If the original document is small (for example, your passport) the notary will issue a notarial certificate and attach it to the original instead.

3. Return your original document and your notarised photocopy to you immediately afterwards.

### Pay the fee

You can pay by card or cash.

## Documents that can be notarised

Copies of documents that can be notarised include:

- passports
- photocard driving licences

## Notarisation fees

Fees are standardised across notary publics and locations but they vary depending on the document. Most are between BBD $10–50.

### Example fees

- Notarial seal (when a notary issues an official stamp to authenticate a document) BBD $50

- Notarial certificate (when a notary issues a statement to authenticate a document) BBD $50
