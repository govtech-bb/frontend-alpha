This service can be used to get a copy of a marriage certificate for any couple whose marriage was registered in Barbados.

Most copies of marriage certificates are requested at the time the marriage takes place. A copy is essential for proving your legal marital status and changing your name on documents such as your passport, driver’s licence and bank accounts. It’s also necessary for access to certain welfare support.

However, copies can be requested at any point. You may need one to support the immigration status of your spouse, or for adding dependents to health/life insurance.

You can request a copy on someone else’s behalf but you must disclose:

- your relationship to them
- why you need the certificate

## How to get a copy of a marriage certificate

### Complete the form online

There are two ways to get a copy of a marriage certificate. You can:

1. Request a copy online

You must pay online so you will need a debit or credit card, and you will need to have (or create) an EZPay+ account.
Every question is compulsory so if you are unsure about the basic information asked for, you should complete the paper form instead.

2. Get a paper Application for marriage certificate form from the Registration Department

You must complete it by hand and return it to the department. You can pay with cash or by card when you collect it.
If you are unsure about the basic details asked for (for example, if there is estrangement in the family), you should complete the paper form.

## Cost of certificates

Each certified copy costs $10 BBD if you are a Barbadian national. For non-nationals, each copy is $20 BBD.

## After your request is processed

A certificate is usually ready to collect in 5 to 7 business days.

A certificate can sometimes be issued on the same day, in the case of a medical or travel emergency. You will need to show proof of the emergency.

If you complete the paper form, you will be given a receipt when you return it to the Applications Desk at the Registration Department. You will need to show your receipt when you collect your cop(y/ies) and you will be able to pay in cash or by card.

## If basic information is unknwon

There are circumstances when you may not be able to provide all the information asked for in the form. For example, if there is estrangement in the family, or if the birth was registered in Barbados a significant time ago. Provide as much information as you can – the more details you can give, the better the chance of finding the records you are looking for.
