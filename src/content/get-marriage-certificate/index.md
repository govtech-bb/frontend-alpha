This service can be used to get a copy of a marriage certificate for any couple whose marriage was registered in Barbados. 

Most copies of marriage certificates are requested at the time the marriage takes place. A copy is essential for proving your legal marital status and changing your name on documents such as your passport, driver’s licence and bank accounts. It’s also necessary for access to certain welfare support. 

However, copies can be requested at any point. You may need one to support the immigration status of your spouse, or for adding dependents to health/life insurance.

You can request a copy on someone else’s behalf but you must disclose:

- your relationship to them  
- why you need the certificate
