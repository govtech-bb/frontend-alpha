If you would like to sell goods or services on a beach or in a park, you must have a valid licence. You can apply for one here.

Licences are valid for 1 year and need to be renewed by 30 June each year.

Goods are physical items such as food or memorabilia. Services are experiences like massages or water sports.

## How to apply

You can collect a paper form from the National Conservation Commission (NCC), complete it by hand, and return it to the NCC at:

Codrington Road,  
Bridgetown,

You can also return a paper application form by post. However, returning it in person can speed up the process because NCC colleagues may be able to check your application for missing information and let you know immediately.

## What you need to share when you apply

- where you would like to sell them
- where your goods are made or sourced from

You will also be asked to upload:

- a [Police Certificate of Character](https://forms.gov.bb/CertificateOfCharacter)
- 2 passport-sized pictures of yourself

## After you apply

Representatives from the NCC will invite you to meet with them at the location where you would like to sell goods or services. They will assess suitability and determine if there is a specific area you could sell in.

If the outcome is positive, you will be asked to visit the National Conservation Commission to collect:

1. A letter of authorisation.
2. A licence book outlining the conditions of where and what you can sell.

The NCC will let you know when your vendor identification is ready to collect.
