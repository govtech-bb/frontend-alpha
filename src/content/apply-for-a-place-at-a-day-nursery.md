Parents and guardians of children under the age of 5 can apply for them to go to a government-run day nursery. Nursery places are decided on a case-by-case basis. It is a good idea to apply for at least 3 nurseries.

## When to apply

You can apply for a place as soon as a child is born. However, if your application is successful, the child cannot start attending the nursery until they are 3 months old.

Applications are open all year round.

## How to apply

### Get an application form

This service is not available online yet so you must go to each nursery you want to apply to. (Three is recommended). A supervisor completes an application form for you, and will ask:

- your name

- your address

- your contact number

- the child’s name

- the child’s date of birth

- the child’s sex

- if the child has allergies and/or medical conditions

- your relationship to the child

### What to take

You will need to take your child’s Green Book which has their medical background recorded.

### Before you leave the nursery

The supervisor will give you a copy of the completed form. You should refer to the application number on the form if you need to contact the nursery again.

## After you’ve applied

The supervisor and a senior officer for the daycare programme will check your eligibility and whether there’s space for your child in the nursery you’ve applied to.

### If your application is successful

If your child is eligible and a place is available, they will be enrolled at the nursery immediately, or, at the start of the new term in September.

Before your child begins daycare, you will be invited to an orientation session so you can get to know the nursery, sign the acceptance document, and recap on your child’s allergies and medical conditions

### What to bring to the orientation

You will need to share:

1. A photocopy of the child’s birth certificate to confirm their mother’s, father’s name if included and the child’s date of birth.

2. Passport-sized photo of child for identification and their file

### If your application is unsuccessful

If your child is eligible but a place is not currently available, they will be put on a reserve list.

## Accessibility

If you cannot attend the nursery to complete an application form, you can send a representative. However, a parent or guardian must attend the orientation session.
