You should complete your application in one go. At the moment, it is not possible to save your answers and come back to them later.

## How long does it take?

It should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete the registration form.

## What you will need

Before you start, you will need to know:

1. The student’s name, ID number and class.
2. The name of the child’s school and principal.
3. Bank account information so the funds can be paid.
4. The details of a bank account that is used regularly and has been used within the last 3 months. If your bank account is frozen, the funds will not reach you.
