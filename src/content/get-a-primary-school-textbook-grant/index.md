Each academic year, every child is entitled to a $100 BDD textbook grant while they are a student at a public or private primary school. The aim of this initiative is to financially support parents and guardians so that their children have access to books which will support their learning.

## Application and eligibility guidance

Parents or guardians can only register each child once per year.

Your completed form will be sent to the principal at the child’s school for approval. This means:

1. If you have more than one child at the same school, you only need to complete one form to claim on behalf of each child.
2. If you have children at different schools, you will need to complete separate forms.

If the child is currently receiving support through the Primary School Textbook system, you are not eligible to claim the Primary School Textbook Grant as well.

## When to register

You can register for the grant any time but registering in June or July means the funds are more likely to be available in time for the start of the new school year.

## How to register

To register, you can complete the online form.

The form asks for:

1. Bank account information so the funds can be paid.
2. The student’s name, ID number and class.
3. The name of the child’s school and principal.
4. The parent or guardian’s contact details.

## After you’ve registered

The school will check the eligibility of your claim and make sure it has not received more than one claim within the academic year. Approval needs to be given by the principal before the payment details you gave are added to the system and you receive BDS $100.

## If you cannot complete the form online

You can get support by:

1. Making an appointment at your child’s school.
2. Visiting the Ministry of Educational Transformation at:

   Elsie Payne Complex  
   Constitution Road  
   St.Michael
