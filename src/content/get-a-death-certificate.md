When someone dies and their death is registered in Barbados, their next of kin (the deceased’s closest living relative or relatives) can use this service to get a death certificate. 

Certificates for Barbadian citizens can be requested at any point. However, the Registration Department does not issue certificates for deaths which were registered before 1925.

Most death certificates are requested at the same time a death is registered because a certificate is essential for things like closing the deceased’s bank accounts and getting a funeral grant.

## How to get a certificate

You cannot request a certificate online yet, so you need to get an Application for death certificate form from the Registration Department in person, and complete it by hand.

### Complete the form

The form asks for details including the name of the person who has died and their date of death, as well as the details of the person requesting the certificate.

### Pay the fee

You can pay in cash or by card at the Registration Department. You will need to keep your receipt for collection. 
The original certificate costs BDS $5. Case of death certificate is BDS $10

### Submit your request

Submit your form and supporting information to the Registration Department to the certificate clerk.

## After your request is processed

A certificate is usually ready in 2 to 3 working days. You will need to show your receipt and collect your certification from the Registration Department. A certificate can sometimes be issued on the same day, in the case of a medical or travel emergency. You will need to show proof of the emergency.
