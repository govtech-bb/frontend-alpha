All births in Barbados (including stillbirths) must be registered within 28 days of the child being born. 

You can pre-register the birth online but to complete the registration, the parent(s) or guardian(s) must go to the magistrates court in the district where the child was born. They will need to sign the birth register in person. 

Pre-registering online takes around 10 minutes.

- child’s first name, middle names, last name and sex 

- parents’ first names, middle names, last names and current address(es)
