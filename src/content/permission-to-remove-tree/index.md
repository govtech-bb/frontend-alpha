If you want to remove a tree that is protected under the Trees (Preservation) Act, 1981, you must apply for permission. If your application is successful, the Chief Town Planner will grant you a permit.

## Who can apply

You can only apply if you are the legal owner of the land where the tree is located.

## How to apply

### After you have applied

Within 28 days of receiving it, the Chief Town Planner or their team will review your application in line with the Trees (Preservation) Act, 1981.

You will receive a decision once the review is complete.

If your application is successful, you will be granted a permit to remove the tree(s). A permit lasts for 1 year from the date of issue.
