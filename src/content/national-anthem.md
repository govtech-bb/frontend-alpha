**National Anthem**

In plenty and in time of need   
When this fair land was young   
Our brave forefathers sowed the seed   
From which our pride is sprung,   
A pride that makes no wanton boast   
Of what it has withstood   
That binds our hearts from coast to coast -   
The pride of nationhood

**Chorus:**

We loyal sons and daughters all   
Do hereby make it known   
These fields and hills beyond recall   
Are now our very own.   
We write our names on history's page   
With expectations great,   
Strict guardians of our heritage,   
Firm craftsmen of our fate   
  
The Lord has been the people's guide   
For past three hundred years.   
With him still on the people's side   
We have no doubts or fears.   
Upward and onward we shall go,   
Inspired, exulting, free,   
And greater will our nation grow   
In strength and unity. 

**The Music**

When Mr. C. Van Roland Edwards composed the Music for the National Anthem he was partially blind. Mr. Edwards was born in 1912 and had been writing music from his school days as a pupil of St. Peter's Church Boy's School. Although he had no formal training he had been a member of the British Song society since 1933. Because of his partial blindness has was assisted in his work by his two daughters Nannette and Eullia.

Mr. Edwards was known for his compositions "The St. Andrew Murder", "The Goodman song" and "The Federation song". He also composed "Welcome to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II" which was sung in the presence of the Queen when she opened the St. Elizabeth School in St. Joseph during the official visit to the island in February 1966.

A committee which comprised, Mr. Bruce St. John, Mr. Frank Collymore, Mrs. Enid Lynch, Mr. George Lamming, Mr. Gerald Hudson and Mr. John Fletcher was appointed to oversee the selection of the national Anthem. Mr. Edwards was awarded $500 for his efforts.

Mr. Edwards died on April 22, 1985. In 1967 the music of the National Anthem was re-arranged. This work was undertaken by Inspector Prince Cave of the Royal Barbados Police Band. He had earlier that year returned from a three year Band Masters course at the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall. The Anthem was given a more sustained harmony while at the same time retaining the original tune.
