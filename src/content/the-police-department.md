The Barbados Police Service (BPS), as established under the Police Act, of 1961(a), and the Constitution of Barbados is a part of the government responsible for local law enforcement. The RBPF is divided into three territorial divisions, the Operations Support Division, the Administrative Support Division and the Criminal Investigations Division. The organisation structure of the RBPF is modelled after London's Metropolitan Police Service.

## History

The main Police Force of Barbados was established in 1835. Soon after its founding the Police Force informally had mounted policemen, however, in 1880 an actual mounted division was recognised and known as the Mounted Corps. (later renamed the Mounted Branch in 1933.) In 1882, the Harbour Police Force was unified with the main land division after it had been established separately in 1867. Roughly 100 years later in the 1980s, the Harbour Police unit was dissolved entirely.

The prefix "Royal" was added to the title of the Police Force in February 1966 due to a visit by the Queen. Since that time, "Royal" has remained as part of the name and identity of the force.

In 1981, the RBPF became a full member of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol).

## Organisation

The headquarters for the RBPF is in the former Barclays Bank Complex on Lower Roebuck Street, Bridgetown, Saint Michael.

The headquarters houses the Commissioner of Police; the Deputy Commissioner of Police; the offices of all assistant commissioners of police; all staff officers of the above commissioners; the secretary to the Commissioner of Police; the Research and Development Department; the Police Registry; and the Office of Compliance.
