The Sanitation Services Authority includes four engineering infrastructure items (even though often only the first one is strongly associated with the term “sanitation”): excreta management systems, wastewater management systems (including wastewater treatment plants), solid waste management systems, and drainage systems for rainwater (also called storm water drainage).
