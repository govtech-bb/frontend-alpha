The Barbados tourism industry has shown steady growth over the last 50 years despite periods of relative instability driven by world economic and Geo-political crises. Travel and tourism is expected to grow by 4.6% per annum, in real terms, between 2002 and 2012. The travel and tourism economic contribution should rise from 37.4% to 43.8% during that same period.
