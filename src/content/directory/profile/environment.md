**Strategies**

The importance of the role of the Ministry of Environment and National Beautification, within the context of the integrated planning and resource management, cannot be over-emphasized, as we continue to strive to make a positive contribution to preserve, conserve and enhance the growth of our society, economy and country as a whole, within the limitation of our existing human, financial, natural and legislative resources.

Fundamental environmental management areas must be, but not necessarily limited to:

- Green Economy â€“ Consumption and Production
- Waste Management

**We Plantin**

    * Vision for Planting Trees
      * By planting trees, we commit to the future of joining the world community, in implementing strategies and actions, that will reduce the rate of climate change, thus, creating a more sustainable world, for our children and grandchildren.
      * Ladies and gentlemen, this is therefore a defining moment; a time to write a new chapter; a chapter which satisfies our international commitments; protects and preserves our national resources; and guarantees a more sustainable future, for our country.

    * OBJECTIVES

      * The National Tree Planting project will endeavor to plant trees for a purpose; we will plant for:
      * Capturing emissions from greenhouse gases
      * Creating and maintaining a healthy environment and ecosystem â€“ within aware and responsible communities
      * Increasing the availability of nutritional supplements â€“ provided by trees (shrubs, crops and herbs)
      * Reducing the occurrence of non-communicable diseases, by ensuring that we produce and consume foods, by using more organic and natural means
    * By planting more than a million trees, we hope to benefit from the marriage between human and nature. Trees will be planted with the purpose of serving our Island, its citizens and its visitors, now; while providing the natural infrastructure for a clean, safe and prosperous Barbados â€“ for our loved ones into the future.
