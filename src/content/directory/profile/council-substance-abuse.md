The National Council on Substance Abuse (NCSA) was established as a Statutory Board in May 1995 under the aegis of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Our mandate is based on drug demand reduction in schools and the wider community. The Organisation is managed by a Board of Directors and a team of trained staff who coordinates and implements specific programs and projects for various target audiences in Barbados.
