The National Housing Corporation is committed to finding acceptable Housing solutions for Barbadians at affordable prices. This will be achieved through the maximization of available land:- producing more efficiently sized lots and constructing additional high rise apartments, quadruple and duplex units instead of a predominance of single units.
