### Quick Summary

Royal warrant granted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1966. Features Pride of Barbados flowers, Bearded Fig Tree, dolphin and pelican supporters. Motto: "Pride and Industry". Designed by Neville C. Connell.

### Historical Background

The grant of arms was conveyed by royal warrant and presented by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to the President of the Senate on February 14, 1966, during the Royal Visit to Barbados.

Prior to this grant, the only heraldic device was the colonial seal showing the British Sovereign in a shell chariot drawn by two sea horses through foaming waves. The seal changed with each new monarch (King sits, Queens stand).

### Design Elements

**Golden Shield:**
- Two Pride of Barbados flowers (Caesalpinia pulcherrima - the National Flower)
- Bearded Fig Tree (Ficus citrifolia), common when the island was settled

**Supporters:**
- Right (Dexter): Dolphin - symbolic of the fishing industry
- Left (Sinister): Pelican - associated with Pelican Island, incorporated into Deep Water Harbour

**Crest:**
- Helmet and mantling above the shield
- Arm and hand of a Barbadian holding two crossed sugar cane pieces
- Forms a saltire cross (Saint Andrew's cross)
- Symbolizes the sugar industry
- Connection to Independence Day (November 30 - Saint Andrew's Day)

**Motto:** "Pride and Industry"

### Designer

Designed by Mr. Neville C. Connell, Director of the Barbados Museum for almost 24 years. He was a prolific writer, contributing articles to Museum Journals, local newspapers, and overseas publications.
