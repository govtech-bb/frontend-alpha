## HIV/AIDS Programme Office

Since its establishment in 2001, the Barbados National HIV/AIDS Commission has remained ever vigilant in executing its mandate of creating and strengthening partnerships which in turn foster an expanded response to HIV across all sectors. HIV is no longer viewed as primarily a health issue but one which affects national development.
