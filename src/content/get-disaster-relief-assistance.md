If you are affected by a natural disaster like a hurricane, a flood or an earthquake, you can apply for disaster relief support from the government. You can also use this service to apply for relief assistance in smaller-scale incidents. For example, if heavy winds have significantly damaged your home.

Different types of support are available including:

1. Immediate relief such as getting access to food and shelter.

2. Non-urgent support such as repairing damage to homes and property.

## How to get immediate relief

Report the emergency to the:

Welfare Department.  
Perry Gap,  
Bridgetown,  
Saint Michael Barbados  
[+1 246-535-1000](tel:+12465351000)  

Depending on the scale and the severity of the incident, a social worker or a representative from the Department of Emergency Management (DEM) will travel to where you are. They will assess the situation and determine the most appropriate support. 

If friends and family are unable to help you and you need:

1. food, you can go to the Welfare Department. 
2. shelter, speak to the social worker attending the incident about temporary accommodation.
