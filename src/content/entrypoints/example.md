# Example Entry Point

This is an example entry point that demonstrates how markdown files are rendered within the site's layout.

## What this shows

- Markdown content styled with the site's design system
- Frontmatter integration for metadata
- Clean, accessible government service information

You can create more entry points by adding markdown files to the `src/content/entrypoints/` directory.
