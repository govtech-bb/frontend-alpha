## Stub Page Format

Each stub page follows the format defined in `PLAN.md`:

### YAML Front Matter
```yaml
---
title: "Service Name"
type: "stub"
category: "services/subcategory"
sourceUrl: "https://www.gov.bb/original/path"
captureDate: "2025-10-09"
description: "AI-generated concise summary of the service..."
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...]
relatedPages:
  - "path/to/related/page1"
  - "path/to/related/page2"
---
```

### Content Structure
1. **Migration notice** - Explains content is on existing gov.bb
2. **Quick Summary** - Repeats description for quick reference
3. **Detailed sections** - Key information extracted from source
4. **Contact information** - Phone, address, hours when available
5. **Related information** - Links to related services

## Category Index Pages

Each category has an `_index.md` file that:
- Introduces the category
- Lists available services/pages
- Provides context and guidance
- Links to related categories
- Includes contact information when relevant

## Content Sources

All stub content generated from scraped content in:
`/Users/matt/Development/GovTech/govdotbb/scraped-content-gov-bb/content/`

Each stub includes:
- AI-generated descriptions under 200 characters
- Key information extracted from source material
- Actionable details (fees, documents, locations)
- Related service links for navigation

## Information Architecture

Content organized using user-centric IA:

### Three Top-Level Categories

1. **Services** - Organized by user needs
   - Life Events (births, marriages, deaths)
   - Identity (ID cards, passports, licences)
   - Business (starting, registering, taxes)
   - Employment (jobs, NIS, workplace rights)

2. **Government** - Organized by structure
   - Ministries (policy-making)
   - Departments (service delivery)
   - Agencies (specialized mandates)

3. **About Barbados** - Information about the nation
   - National Symbols (coat of arms, anthem, flag)
   - History (independence, heritage)
   - Visiting (visa info, getting around)

## Next Steps (from PLAN.md)

### Phase 1 Remaining (Week 1):
- ✅ Create PLAN.md
- ✅ Read existing stub format
- ✅ Analyze scraped content structure
- ✅ Create directory structure
- ✅ Generate first 20 stub pages manually

### Phase 2: Python Search Server (Week 2)
- [ ] Setup Python environment
- [ ] Build content indexer
- [ ] Create FastAPI search API
- [ ] Test with sample content
- [ ] Document usage

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Update homepage with directory section
- [ ] Create Next.js route structure (`/app/directory/`)
- [ ] Create category pages
- [ ] Create stub page template
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation

### Phase 4: Content Generation (Week 4)
- [ ] Build batch generation script
- [ ] Generate remaining stubs from scraped content
- [ ] Review and refine
- [ ] Update search index
- [ ] Final testing

## Git Status

Branch: `search-and-stub` (branched from `main`)

### Files Added:
- `PLAN.md` - Complete implementation plan
- `src/content/directory.md` - Main directory landing
- 12 stub pages in `src/content/directory/`
- 8 category index pages
- `DIRECTORY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This summary

## Success Metrics (from PLAN.md)

Phase 1 Complete:
- ✅ Hierarchical organization established
- ✅ Clear navigation structure
- ✅ Representative sample of stubs (12 pages)
- ✅ All stubs link to source URLs
- ✅ Consistent format across all stubs
- ✅ Documentation created

Remaining:
- ⏳ 200+ stub pages (batch generation needed)
- ⏳ Working semantic search
- ⏳ Search index covers 100% of stubs
- ⏳ Integration with homepage

## Technical Notes

### Stub Page Best Practices Established

1. **Descriptions:** Under 200 characters, action-oriented
2. **Keywords:** 4-8 relevant search terms
3. **Related Pages:** 2-4 logical connections
4. **Contact Info:** Always include phone/address when available
5. **Source Attribution:** Always link to original gov.bb URL
6. **Capture Date:** Documents when content was sourced

### Navigation Patterns

- Breadcrumb-friendly paths (e.g., `services/life-events/register-birth`)
- Parent category links in every page
- Related services cross-linking
- Clear hierarchy: directory → category → subcategory → page

### Content Quality

- AI-generated summaries validated against source
- Key actionable information prioritized
- Fees, documents, locations always included when available
- Clear "content not migrated yet" messaging
- Links to full information on existing gov.bb

## Ready for Phase 2

With Phase 1 complete, the foundation is set for:

1. **Python Search Server** - Index these 12 stubs as initial test data
2. **Frontend Integration** - Build Next.js routes for directory navigation
3. **Batch Generation** - Scale to 200+ stubs using established patterns
4. **Search Integration** - Connect FastAPI server to Next.js frontend
